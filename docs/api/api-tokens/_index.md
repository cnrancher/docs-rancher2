title: API Tokens
---

By default, some cluster-level API tokens are generated with infinite time-to-live (`ttl=0`). In other words, API tokens with `ttl=0` never expire unless you invalidate them. Tokens are not invalidated by changing a password.

You can deactivate API tokens by deleting them or by deactivating the user account.

To delete a token,

1. Go to the list of all tokens in the Rancher API view at `https://<Rancher-Server-IP>/v3/tokens`.

1. Access the token you want to delete by its ID. For example, `https://<Rancher-Server-IP>/v3/tokens/kubectl-shell-user-vqkqt`

1. Click **Delete.**

Here is the complete list of tokens that are generated with `ttl=0`:
