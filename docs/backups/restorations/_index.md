If you lose the data on your Rancher Server, you can restore it if you have backups stored in a safe location.

- [Restoring Backups—Kubernetes installs](/docs/backups/restorations/ha-restoration/)

If you are looking to restore your [Rancher launched Kubernetes cluster](/docs/cluster-provisioning/rke-clusters/), please refer [here](/docs/cluster-admin/restoring-etcd/).
