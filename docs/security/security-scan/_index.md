title: Security Scans
---

_Available as of v2.4.0-alpha1_

Rancher can run a security scan to check whether Kubernetes is deployed according to security best practices as defined in the CIS (Center for Internet Security) Kubernetes Benchmark.

The CIS Kubernetes Benchmark is a reference document that can be used to establish a secure configuration baseline for Kubernetes. The Benchmark provides recommendations of two types: Scored and Not Scored. We run tests related to only Scored recommendations.

When Rancher runs a CIS Security Scan on a cluster, it generates a report showing the results of each test, including a summary with the number of passed, skipped and failed tests. The report also includes remediation steps for any failed tests.

To check clusters for CIS Kubernetes Benchmark compliance, the security scan leverages [kube-bench,](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench) an open-source tool from Aqua Security.

#### About the Generated Report

Each scan generates a report can be viewed in the Rancher UI and can be downloaded in CSV format.

To determine which version of the [Benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes/) to use in the scan, Rancher chooses a version that is appropriate for the cluster's Kubernetes version. The Benchmark version is included in the generated report.

Each test in the report is identified by its corresponding Scored test in the Benchmark. For example, if a cluster fails test 1.3.6, you can look up the description and rationale for the section 1.3.6 in the Benchmark itself, or in Rancher's [hardening guide for the Kubernetes version that the cluster is using.](/docs/security/#rancher-hardening-guide) Recommendations marked as Not Scored in the Benchmark are not included in the report.

Similarly, for information on how to manually audit the test result, you could look up section 1.3.6 in Rancher's [self-assessment guide for the corresponding Kubernetes version.](/docs/security/#the-cis-benchmark-and-self-assessment)

#### Prerequisites

To run security scans on a cluster and access the generated reports, you must be an [Administrator](/docs/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/) or [Cluster Owner.](/docs/admin-settings/rbac/cluster-project-roles/)

Rancher can only run security scans on clusters that were created with RKE, which includes custom clusters and clusters that Rancher created in an infrastructure provider such as Amazon EC2 or GCE. Imported clusters and clusters in hosted Kubernetes providers can't be scanned by Rancher.

The security scan cannot run in a cluster that has Windows nodes.

#### Running a Scan

1. From the cluster view in Rancher, click **Tools > CIS Scans.**
1. Click **Run Scan.**

**Result:** A report is generated and displayed in the **CIS Scans** page. To see details of the report, click the report's name.

#### Skipping a Test

1. From the cluster view in Rancher, click **Tools > CIS Scans.**
1. Click the name of the report that has tests you want to skip.
1. A **Skip** button is displayed next to each failed test. Click **Skip** for each test that should be skipped.

**Result:** The tests will be skipped on the next scan.

To re-run the security scan, go to the top of the page and click **Run Scan.**

#### Un-skipping a Test

1. From the cluster view in Rancher, click **Tools > CIS Scans.**
1. Click the name of the report that has tests you want to un-skip.
1. An **Unskip** button is displayed next to each skipped test. Click **Unskip** for each test that should not be skipped.

**Result:** The tests will not be skipped on the next scan.

To re-run the security scan, go to the top of the page and click **Run Scan.**

#### Deleting a Report

1. From the cluster view in Rancher, click **Tools > CIS Scans.**
1. Go to the report that should be deleted.
1. Click the **Ellipsis (...) > Delete.**
1. Click **Delete.**
